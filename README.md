>"Donâ€™t set your mind on things you donâ€™t possess as if they were
yours, but count the blessings you actually possess and think how
much you would desire them if they werenâ€™t already yours. But
watch yourself, that you donâ€™t value these things to the point of
being troubled if you should lose them."
